# Music Recommender System Using Python
___
This project demonstrates the creation of a music recommender system using Python. It includes text data preprocessing, implementation of recommendation logic, and analysis of a song dataset.
___
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a system that recommends music based on specific criteria or user preferences. The project is divided into the following main sections:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing data and preparing text for analysis.
2. **Recommender Function**: Implementing the logic to generate music recommendations.
___
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is **spotify_millsongdata.csv**, which contains information such as:
- Song lyrics
- Metadata (e.g., artist, title)
___
## Steps and Methodology
1. **Data Loading**:
   - The dataset is loaded using `pandas`.
   - A sample of 500 rows is used for processing.
2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization, lemmatization, and other NLP techniques are applied using the `nltk` library.
   - Stopwords are removed, and song lyrics are cleaned.
3. **Recommendation Logic**:
   - A custom function is implemented to recommend songs based on textual similarity or metadata.
___
## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `nltk` for natural language processing
- `re` for regular expression-based text cleaning
___
## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas nltk
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the workflow and test the recommender system.
___
## Results
- The system suggests relevant songs based on similarity in lyrics and metadata.
- The project highlights the use of text preprocessing in building a basic recommender system.
___
## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate a more advanced model, such as content-based or collaborative filtering.
- Include additional features like genre or user ratings for more accurate recommendations.
